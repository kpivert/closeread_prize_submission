## At a Glance

-   2024 marked the 11th iteration of ASN's annual Nephrology Fellow Survey. Of the 962 current adult, pediatric, and adult/pediatric nephrology fellows in training, 447 participated (46% response rate). (See [V. Pediatric Nephrology Fellows] for details on pediatric nephrology fellow responses.)

-   Nine out of 10 fellows (91%) would recommend medical students and residents pursue nephrology (IMGs, 88%; USMGs, 94%).

-   Lifestyle factors—call frequency, desired practice location, and vacation time—continued to be highly valued by fellows when considering job offers. For the first time since 2021 compensation was among the top five overall factors rated "extremely important."

-   Of the 189 adult fellows completing fellowship, 34 (18%) were seeking additional training, mainly in nephrology–critical care medicine (CCM, 14 fellows) and transplant nephrology (12).

-   Only about one-third of participating international medical graduates (IMGs, 37%) perceived an appropriate number of employment opportunities within a 50-mile radius of their training institution, compared with half of United States medical graduates (USMGs, 53%).

-   Adult fellows received multiple employment offers (median 3 offers) and were starting their first post-fellowship positions across 39 different states and the District of Columbia, with half (50%) entering private practice.

-   Median base starting salary was \$240,000 (interquartile range \[IQR\] \$64,000), up 4% from the 2023 survey. There were narrow differences between men (median \$240,000) and women (\$238,500).

-   A dedicated transplant nephrology fellow survey instrument was introduced this year, with 9 transplant fellows participating (50% response). Post-fellowship, 3 of the 9 respondents were entering a solely transplant nephrology position, 5 were starting a combined transplant/general nephrology position, and 1 was entering general clinical nephrology. Median base starting salary for this group of respondents was \$250,000 (IQR \$86,000) (see [VI. Transplant Nephrology Fellows]).

## V. Pediatric Nephrology Fellows

::: callout-note
## This Section Reports **PEDIATRIC** Responses Only
:::

#### V.1 Pediatric and Adult/Pediatric Fellow Demographics

This year 45 of 93 current pediatric fellows (48%) and 9 adult/pediatric fellows participated in the survey. Most pediatric fellow participants were USMGs (73%), women (64%), U.S. Citizens (77%), and non-Hispanic Whites (55%). Compared with the most recent ACMGE data on pediatric fellows, there were slightly more White and Hispanic/Latina/Latino and fewer Asian respondents.. USMG pediatric respondents were mainly graduates of allopathic medical schools (85%, 34 fellows).

#### V.2 Educational Debt and Choosing Nephrology

Both pediatric and adult/pediatric participants reported carrying a higher debt burden than adult respondents. Median debt was \$246,000 for pediatric and \$333,000 for adult/pediatric fellows versus \$199,000 for adult fellows. Similar to the adult cohort, a majority of pediatric fellows chose nephrology during their PGY-2 and PGY-3 years of residency (57% vs. 47% for adults), although there were more respondents who were directed to nephrology during their pre-med/medical school training (27% vs. 22% for adults). Except for one respondent, nearly every pediatric and adult/pediatric fellow participant would recommend the specialty to medical students and pediatric residents (98%, 52 fellows, vs. 90%, 353 adult fellows).

#### V.3 Future Plans

Two-thirds of respondents (67%, 36 fellows) were continuing their current fellowship, with 12 respondents entering academic practice (22%), 2 pursuing additional training (4%), and 1 participant (2%) each entering private practice, pediatrics residency, and undecided at survey time.

::::{.cr-section}

All but 2 pediatric respondents planned to remain in the U.S. for their first position, with a lower percentage anticipating remaining in the same state (33%) and city/region (24%) as their current fellowship than adult participants (43% and 32%, respectively). @cr-fig20

#### V.4 Job Market Perceptions

Pediatric fellow respondents perceived a soft local job market with only 48% of USMGs and 21% of IMGs indicating and appropriate number of opportunities within 50 miles of their fellowship institution.This could partially explain the lower percentage of pediatric fellows anticipating practicing in the same state and city/region. @cr-fig21

#### V.5 Entering Practice

Sixteen participants had started their job search, with 13 pursuing clinical positions, 2 research positions, and 1 fellow looking for a job in medical education. Pediatric respondents applied for a median 4 positions and received a median 2.5 job offers. At survey time, 12 had accepted positions, 1 had received an offer but was still searching, and 3 had not received any employment offers. Unlike adult fellows, no pediatric respondents had difficulty finding a position they considered satisfactory.

::::{.cr-section}

Of those who accepted a position, 11 fellows were starting in clinical nephrology and 2 were in research positions. A majority (85%, 11 fellows) were employed by a univerity-based hospital, and 2 were working in a non-academic health system. Respondents entering pediatric nephrology practice were anticipating responsibilties for dialysis modalities (PD, CRRT, in-center HD), and outpatient CKD and specialty clinics. @cr-tbl8

## VI. Transplant Nephrology Fellows

::: callout-note
## This Section Reports **TRANSPLANT** Fellow Responses Only
:::

#### VI.1 Transplant Fellow Demographics

Recognizing that the 2019 Advancing American Kidney Health (AAKH) executive order called for "...\[increased\] access to kidney transplants..." a separate ASN Transplant Nephrology Fellow Survey was developed to better understand transplant trainees and the job market for transplant nephrologists. Current transplant fellows were identified by querying training program directors for the 64 accredited transplant nephrology fellowship [programs](https://txnephaccreditation.org/), who identified 18 transplant fellows, 9 of whom participated (50% response). (Not all transplant fellowships responded.)

A slight majority of participating transplant fellows were IMGs, women, and training on J-1 visas (5 fellows, 56% for each variable). Two respondents identified as Hispanic/Latina/Latino (22%), with one-third White, one-third South Asian, and 11% each identified as Black/African American and Southeast Asian (1 preferred not to answer).

::::{.cr-section}

#### VI.2 Choosing Transplant Nephrology

Five decided to subspecialize in transplant during fellowship, 2 during their intern year, and 2 during their 2nd or 3rd years of residency. Two-thirds were attracted to the science and allure of transplant nephrology, with 4 wanting to work in an academic center post-fellowship, and one motivated by their own personal experience as a transplant recipient. @cr-tbl10

::::{.cr-section}

Six of the 9 participating fellows were very satisfied with their choice to pursue tranplant, and all 9 would recommend the subspecialty. Among the reasons to recommend transplant nephrology: @cr-tx-quotes

| {#cr-tx-quotes .scale-to-fill}
| Ability to combine patient care with exciting and interesting science.
| 
| Nephrology is moving towards xenotransplantation and 
| eventually all nephrologists will require transplant training.
|
| It’s a combination of so many different fields including 
| immunology, pathology, infectious disease, etc. 
| No patient is the same.
|
| Despite lower salary and complex patient population, 
| the kidney transplant patient-physician journey, 
| from pre-transplant evaluation to life with a 
| functioning graft is very gratifying. 
| However, salary and work life balance should improve.

::::

Respondents indicated that transplant could be made more attractive by improving educational curriculum and making the fellowship standardized (2 fellows), improving compensation (2) and lifestyle/work-life balance (2), attaining ACGME accreditation (1), and increasing visa sponsorship opportunities (1 fellow).

#### VI.3 Job Search Experiences and First Positions

All participants were searching for employment either in solely transplant nephrology (5 fellows), transplant nephrology combined with general nephrology (5), or general clinical nephrology (1 fellow). Every participant had accepted an employment offer, although 3 experienced difficulty finding a position they considered satisfactory because of visa requirements (2 fellows), lack of positions in a desired location (1) or practice setting (1), or inadequate salary (1 fellow).


::::{.cr-section}

In their first post-fellowship position, one-third were focused solely on transplant nephrology (3 fellows), with 5 entering combined transplant/general nephrology practice, and one starting a general clinical nephrology position. Five respondents were starting in an academic hospital/health system, 2 in a non-academic/independent transplant center, and 2 in private practice. Eight out of 9 were preparing to oversee outpatient transplant clinics with one starting as a transplant center director. @cr-tbl11

## Methods

### Why does ASN survey nephrology fellows in training?

Since 2014, ASN has conducted an annual fellow survey to understand:

-   The composition of the incoming workforce, including race, ethnicity, and gender
-   Motivating factors for choosing the specialty to tailor approaches to sustain interest in nephrology
-   Potential gaps in nephrology education
-   Demand for nephrologists in the U.S.

### How was the survey constructed?

The survey instrument comprised:

-   Longitudinal questions drawn from the original 2014 survey focusing on job search experiences, perceptions of the specialty, practice patterns, and demographics
-   Questions developed by the ASN Data Subcommittee to assess nephrology fellows' training experiences and perceptions of the specialty.

The final instrument was piloted by ASN Data Subcommittee members and distributed via Qualtrics.

### Who were surveyed?

The 2024 ASN Nephrology Fellow Survey was distributed to a survey frame of 962 adult, pediatric, and adult/pediatric nephrology fellows drawn from the ASN (869 adult fellows) and American Society for Pediatric Nephrology (93 fellows) member databases. T he survey received a 46% response rate, with participation from 393 adult, 45 pediatric, and 9 adult/pediatric fellows in training.

A separate Transplant Fellow Survey was developed for transplant nephrology fellows and distributed to 18 transplant fellows provided by current transplant fellowship TPDs. Of these, 9 participated (50% response rate).

### When was the survey conducted?

Invitation emails were sent to adult fellows on April 30 (May 7 for the Transplant Fellow Survey) and the survey closed on May 22, 2024. Participating fellows were eligible to win one of 10 complimentary one-year ASN memberships or one of two complimentary BRCU registrations.

### How were responses analyzed?

The ASN Nephrology Fellow Survey was reviewed and approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Research Board (Study \# 00205206). Data obtained from 2024 responses were analyzed using R (R Core Team (2024). *R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing*.
